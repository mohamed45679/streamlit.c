 predict car prices using machine learning:

 The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that 
can accurately forecast the prices of cars based on various input parameters

 Predicting car prices using machine learning involves training a model on historical data containing features such as car make
 model, condition, location,and other relevant factors, and their corresponding prices. Once the model is trained,
it can be used to predict the price of a car given its features.
